# Frontend Books

A repo that aims to collect Frontend Books and resources for learning some skills needed on the web development. It's recommended to:

1. Read them, and think if it's worth to recommend to anyone.

2. Add a resource here if you feel it's good or heard people saying so.

> Note: This is just an initial personal preference recommendation.
